Matchmaker MultiPaxos is a MultiPaxos variant that

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    allows us to perform reconfiguration,

  \item
    allows us to have small read and write quorums (like DPaxos),

  \item
    allows us to implement Paxos with fast and classic quorums of size $f+1$
    using $f+1$ acceptors, and

  \item
    gives a concrete and efficient implementation of Vertical Paxos.
\end{itemize}
